(SearchMode) is the search type. Possible values are {1:Min-Max Algorithm ,2: Alpha-Beta Pruning} </br>
(First) is which side goes first. Possible values are {"X": X, who is always the player, goes first, "O": The bot, who is always O, goes first} </br>
(PlayerMode) determines if it is either Player vs CPU or CPU vs CPU. {1: Player vs Player, 2: Player vs CPU} </br>
